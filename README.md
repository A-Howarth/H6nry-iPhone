#Description
I have left jailbreak scene, due to my iPhone 4 with iOS 6 not being supported by WhatsApp anymore.
This is basically what is left after more than three years of iOS 6 (and 7) jailbreak tweak development.

All of these directories contain tweaks, enhancements, or modifications to jailbroken iOS. Many of these are unfinished, most are unpolished. Some projects contain pretty nice algorithms, techniques, and well done code. (Most of them are not, to be honest.)

As all of this has some kind of functionality, I can encourage *aspiring developers* to have a look at these projects.
They are retarded, but by reading through the code you will get "that" kind of feeling about how to achieve something.
(I pretty much learned everything by reading the Apple docs and looking at other open source projects.)

You can find compiled versions for many of these projects at my Cydia repo: https://h6nry.github.io/repo/

It has been an awesome three years, thank you everyone for more than 44859 downloads just at the BigBoss repo! This is insane!
Goodbye, and see you: eta sonâ„¢
