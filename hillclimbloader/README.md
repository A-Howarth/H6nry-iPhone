This is awesome. It allows you to theme the sounds of the AppStore game "Hill Climb Racing". And potentially hundreds of thousands of other games as well. It hooks the Cocos2D Sound API.
My dream would have been that HCL actually extended Winterboard functionality through some sort of official theming plugin system.
